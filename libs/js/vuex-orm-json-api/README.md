# Vuex ORM JSON:API - A JSON:API adapter for Vuex ORM

Vuex ORM JSON:API is a Vuex ORM library plugin for reading the JSON:API format. It contains mechanisms for transforming
the JSON:API specification's flexible, self-describing documents, resources, attributes, and relationships into their
Vuex ORM analogues of records, attributes, and relations. Also included are RESTful actions that extend the
[Vuex ORM Axios](https://github.com/vuex-orm/plugin-axios) plugin's HTTP actions.

### Installation

1.  Installing via NPM:

    ```
    npm install --save vuex-orm-json-api
    ```

    Installing via Yarn:

    ```
    yarn add vuex-orm-json-api
    ```

2.  Importing the plugin:

    ```
    import axios from 'axios';
    import VuexORM from '@vuex-orm/core';
    import VuexOrmJsonApi, {RestfulActionsMixin} from 'vuex-orm-json-api';
    
    VuexORM.use(VuexOrmJsonApi, {axios, mixins: [RestfulActionsMixin]});
    ```

### Usage

Assuming that you've included the `RestfulActionsMixin`, the adapter supports five, Ruby on Rails-y RESTful actions:

```
User.jsonApi().index();                             // Get all users.
User.jsonApi().show(1);                             // Get user 1.
User.jsonApi().create({name: 'Harry Bovik'});       // Create a user.
User.jsonApi().update(1, {name: 'Harry Q. Bovik'}); // Update user 1.
User.jsonApi().destroy(1);                          // Destroy user 1.
```

Some considerations:

*   Because JSON:API documents are divided into **primary data** (`data: {}` or `data: []`) and **related resources**
    (`included: []`), all actions come with the side effect of upserting received resources, via `Model.insertOrUpdate`,
    into the Vuex ORM database (or deleting in case of `destroy`).
*   The return value of each action is the upserted record(s) corresponding to the primary data section, with proper
    multiplicity: `Array` for `index`; `Object` for `show`, `create`, and `update`; and `null` for `destroy`.
*  `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, and `destroy` respectively use the `GET`, `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
    HTTP methods. The JSON:API specification seems to prefer `PATCH` over `PUT`.
*   You may pass in a `scope` function to qualify returned records further. For example:

    ```
    await User.jsonApi().show(1, {scope: (query) => query.with('users.group')});
    ```

    Additional overridable options include `url` and `method`.

The adapter may be configured at installation time

```
VuexORM.use(VuexOrmJsonApi, {axios, mixins: [RestfulActionsMixin], apiRoot: '/'});
```

or at the model level:

```
class User extends Model {
  static jsonApiConfig = {
    apiRoot: '/'
  }
}
```

Configuration options include:

*   `apiRoot` - The path prefix to your API routes. The default is `/api`.
*   `resourceToEntityCase` - The converter from JSON:API resource casing to Vuex ORM model casing. The default is a
    simple kebab-to-snake case function, because the JSON:API specification prefers names like `users-groups` and Vuex
    ORM prefers names like `users_groups`.
*   `entityToResourceRouteCase` - The converter from Vue ORM model casing to resource route casing. The default is a
    no-op because this author writes Ruby on Rails API servers, which happen to also use plural snake case.

### Examples

At a fundamental level, the adapter comprehends Vuex ORM relations and transforms the `relationships` found in JSON:API
documents into insertion-ready data. Consider the following models:

```
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields() {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.attr(null),

      groups: this.belongsToMany(Group, UsersGroup, 'user_id', 'group_id'),
    };
  }
}

class Group extends Model {
  static entity = 'groups'

  static fields() {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.attr(null),

      users: this.belongsToMany(User, UsersGroup, 'group_id', 'user_id'),
    };
  }
}

class UsersGroup extends Model {
  static entity = 'users_groups'

  static primaryKey = ['user_id', 'group_id']

  static fields() {
    return {
      user_id: this.attr(null),
      group_id: this.attr(null),
    };
  }
}
```

The somewhat complex setup above involves two models with bidirectional many-to-many relations and an intermediate model
with composite primary key. Upon making the request

```
await User.jsonApi().show(1);
```

and receiving the response

```
{
  data: {
    id: 1,
    type: 'users',
    attributes: {
      name: 'Harry Bovik',
    },
    relationships: {
      groups: {
        data: [
          {id: 1, type: 'groups'},
        ],
      },
    },
  },
  included: [
    {id: 1, type: 'groups', attributes: {name: 'CMU'}},
  ],
}
```

the state of the Vuex store is what we would expect, composite primary keys and all:

```
{
  users: {
    1: {$id: '1', id: 1, name: 'Harry Bovik', users_groups: [], groups: []},
  },
  groups: {
    1: {$id: '1', id: 1, name: 'CMU', users_groups: [], users: []},
  },
  users_groups: {
    '[1,1]': {$id: '[1,1]', id: null, user_id: 1, user: null, group_id: 1, group: null},
  },
}
```

The JSON:API specification allows for self-describing, intrinsically polymorphic relations. How about those?

```
class Monster extends Model {
  static entity = 'monsters'

  static fields() {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.attr(null),

      scaree_id: this.attr(null),
      scaree_type: this.attr(null),
      scaree: this.morphTo('scaree_id', 'scaree_type'),
    };
  }
}

class Child extends Model {
  static entity = 'children'

  static fields() {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.attr(null),

      monster_in_the_closet: this.morphOne(Monster, 'scaree_id', 'scaree_type'),
    };
  }
}
```

Upon making the request

```
await Child.jsonApi().show(1);
```

and receiving the response

```
{
  data: {
    id: 1,
    type: 'children',
    attributes: {
      name: 'Boo',
    },
    relationships: {
      'monster-in-the-closet': {
        data: {id: 1, type: 'monsters'},
      },
    },
  },
  included: [
    {id: 1, type: 'monsters', attributes: {name: 'Sully'}},
  ],
}
```

the query

```
Child.query().whereId(1).with('monster_in_the_closet').first();
```

will return Boo along with her monster friend Sully.

The adapter transforms all types of Vuex ORM relations except for `HasManyThrough`. In the many-to-many example above,
it takes extra care to ensure that records with composite primary keys have those component `*_id` attributes assigned
before insertion. As a result, Vuex ORM can maintain its own concept of primary key in the internal `$id` attribute
independently of the API server's usage of the `id` attribute in JSON:API resources.
